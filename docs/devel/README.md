## How is back compatibility handled?

### What about supporting a span of versions?

Ans:  Spanning more than one version of a component will means a proliferation of test cases, so the recommendation is to be a point in time and not 'this latest version and that slightly older version'.

This will reduce the code test sets to a single configuration (tested in many ways anyways).
